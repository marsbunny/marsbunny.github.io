**Fayetteville High School FBLA Intro to Programming 2024 State Conference entry**

	Created by Abbagail Crumpton, 9th grade, and Kennedy Maness, 10th grade

**Reason for Development**

	The Fayetteville FBLA State Conference 2024 GPA Calculator takes students grades and calculates them into a GPA on the 4.0 scale. 
	GPAs can be calculated on both the weighted and unweighted scale.

**Applications used in Development**

	This application was developed using Python for code, Microsoft Visual Studio Code as the IDE, and GitHub as the app development and operating system. 
	All were used as our tools due to their open-source and beginner friendly environments which made it easier for us to develop our final project.

**Development of our Calculator**

	We faced challenges when it came to creating the weighted part of the scale, as it wasn't as straigtforward as the rest of the calculator's development.
	A majority of the calculator uses basic code and math for its operation.

 **How To Use our Calculator**

	To use our calculator, simply follow the directions given and enter in all of your information correctly.
